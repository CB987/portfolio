<h4>Portfolio:</h4>
<p> I wrapped up a 16-week Immersive Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, DigitalCrafts in January, 2019. It was an intense few months and I learned so much. Like so many things in life, the most rewarding and enjoyable can also be the most challenging at times. Overcoming the challenges equal parts makes it worth doing and makes it enjoyable. </p>

<h4>Built Using:</h4>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>make the projects like folder tabs within the page that reveal the info</li>
    <li>use modal over the project thumbnail for the links to GitHub, live site, etc</li>
    <li>show code in codepen</li>
    <li>use React for part of that?</li>
