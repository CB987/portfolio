<h4>Portfolio: Hire Me!</h4>
<p> I am a student in a 16-week Immersive Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, DigitalCrafts (projected graduation January 17, 2019-- so close!). It has been intense and I have learned so much. Like so many things in life, the most rewarding and enjoyable can also be the most challenging at times. Overcoming the challenges equal parts makes it worth doing and makes it enjoyable. My featured projects are some that I have built as class projects and some that I have worked on on my own. </p>

<h4>Built Using:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ul>
  
<h4>future upgrades:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>make the projects like folder tabs within the page that reveal the info</li>
    <li>use ye olde modal-like-object over the project thumbnail for the links to GitHub, live site, etc</li>
    <li>show code in codepen</li>
    <li>use React for part of that?</li>
  </ul>
